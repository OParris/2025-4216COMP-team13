# To run my visualisations the user must either run the program via jake_questions.py file or via the main.py file. 
# Within the jake_questions.py file there is three seperate functions, Jake_Visualisation_One, Jake_Visualisation_Two and Jake_Visualisation_Three.
# These three functions contain the individual visualisations that I have created, by running the jake_questions.py file, the three functions will be called individualy, starting with number one. A python pop up window will appear containing the first visualisation, once that visualisation has been viewed closing the python pop up window will generate visualisation two and again once viewed close the python pop up window and the third visualisation will appear. The user must have python downlaoded to access the visualisation. 
# Another method to view my visualisaitons is via the main.py file. Within this file, the functions Jake_Visualisation_One, Jake_Visualisation_Two and Jake_Visualisation_Three are pulled from the jake_questions.py file. The main.py file contains a user interface for the user to select which visualisation they would like to view. Once the user has selected which one they would like to view, clicking on the relevent button will generate that individual visualisation in a python pop up window. This process can be repeated as many times as they wish until they close the user interface.
